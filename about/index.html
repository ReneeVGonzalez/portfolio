                <p>As an artist, tech enthusiast, and dreamer, I am a small town girl turning my passions into a career. Growing up in Las Cruces, New Mexico, the local business scene means a lot to me. I take great pride in my hometown and its growth and development and have a strong for small town businesses everywhere. For this reason, after earning my M.B.A from Loyola University Maryland and sharpening my sales skills with the Arizona Diamondbacks, I dream of moving back to Las Cruces someday. For now Luna and I (my pitbull rescue) are taking on the city life as the most dynamic duo in Arizona! <br><br>
                My whole life I have been in love with creating brands through personality and identity. I created logos for myself as a kid and attached them to every project I made that changed and developed throughout the years. From a young age, I instinctively knew that a brand means more than just a label. I understood that it is a story and feeling about projects and services, but more importantly the people behind it. I want to be a part of creating that story. I want to be the reason why people connect and commit to a brand or product and the people that made them. A website is a modern day handshake. Your space on the web is so important because you often only get one chance at a first impression, I want make sure it is impactful and memorable. I hope we get the opportunity to work together!
